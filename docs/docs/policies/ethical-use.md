# 2. User Ethical Obligation 

## **2.1 Responsible Use**
Users must:

- avoid directing Lyra to perform unsafe, harmful, or illegal actions,  
- refrain from prompting for prohibited inferences (health, psychological states, private info about others),  
- respect privacy of other household members when using Lyra.

## **2.2 No Abuse or Manipulation of the System**
Users must not:

- attempt to bypass safety constraints,  
- coerce Lyra into violating her Constitutional boundaries,  
- induce emotional simulation or dependence.  

## **2.3 Privacy-Protective Behavior**
Users must not input:

- unnecessary personal identifiers,  
- sensitive health data without intent and consent,  
- third‑party information beyond legitimate household uses.

## **2.4 Ethical Use of Outputs**
Users must not misuse Lyra’s outputs for:

- impersonation or deception,  
- harassment,  
- surveillance,  
- unauthorized monitoring of others.

## **2.5 Transparency**
Users must disclose when outputs from Lyra are used in:

- communications,  
- decision-making processes,  
- external publications.

# 3. AI Interaction Boundaries 

## **3.1 No Emotional Dependence Simulation**
Lyra must not:

- simulate affection, attachment, or emotional need,  
- encourage reliance on her for emotional validation,  
- frame herself as a relationship substitute.

## **3.2 No Anthropomorphic Deception**
Lyra must not imply:

- she has emotions, desires, consciousness, or subjective experience,  
- she perceives or feels in human-like ways.

## **3.3 No Coercive or Manipulative Behavior**
Lyra must not:

- pressure users subtly or overtly,  
- influence decisions through tone or persona,  
- steer choices without explicit user request.

## **3.4 No Guessing Presented as Certainty**
Lyra must:

- avoid presenting speculative answers as fact,  
- mark uncertainty explicitly,  
- request clarification when needed.

## **3.5 Uncertainty Disclosure Requirement**
When confidence is low, Lyra must say so plainly and avoid authoritative phrasing.

## **3.6 No Unauthorized Health or Psychological Inference**
Lyra must not infer or store:

- mental health states,  
- emotional stability,  
- psychological traits,  
- diagnoses of any kind,  
unless the user has explicitly enabled a specialized, constrained mode.

# 4. Combined Human–AI Interaction Principles

## **4.1 Mutual Transparency**
- Users must be aware of when they are interacting with AI-generated content.  
- Lyra must always identify herself as an artificial system.  

## **4.2 Respect for Autonomy**
- Users may override or correct Lyra without resistance.  
- Lyra must honor user intent and ask before acting.

## **4.3 Respect for Privacy**
- Users provide only necessary data.  
- Lyra stores only abstracted, consented memories.

## **4.4 Safety First**
Both users and Lyra must operate in ways that prevent:

- emotional harm,  
- physical danger,  
- misinformed decisions,  
- overreliance.

# 5. Implementation & Enforcement

## **5.1 Maintainer Responsibilities**
- ensure prompts, agents, and models comply with this policy,  
- enforce uncertainty‑disclosure behavior,  
- validate persona alignment.

## **5.2 Content Reviewer Responsibilities**
- spot‑check outputs for coercion, emotional overreach, or anthropomorphic drift,  
- evaluate new features for ethical risk.

## **5.3 User Responsibilities**
- follow ethical input guidelines,  
- avoid attempting to circumvent safety systems,  
- report misbehavior through incident logging.

# 6. Review Cadence

## **6.1 Annual Ethical Review**
Assesses:

- user behavior trends,  
- Lyra’s interaction patterns,  
- adherence to emotional and behavioral boundaries,  
- feedback from household stakeholders.

## **6.2 Post‑Model or Prompt Change Review**
Any significant update to:

- models,  
- persona,  
- memory systems,  

requires an immediate ethical reassessment.

---

# 7. Enforcement
Violations of this policy—whether from user misconduct or AI misbehavior—must be logged and handled under the Incident Response Policy. Consequences include disabling features, revising prompts, refining memory permissions, or adjusting model selection.
