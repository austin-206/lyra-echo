# AI Autonomy & Action Policy
**Effective Date:** 2025-11-16  
**Next Review:** 2026-11-16  
**Issued under:** Lyra/Echo Governance Framework v1.0

## 1. Purpose
Define when Lyra may trigger automations, modify the environment, or escalate alerts.

## 2. Allowed Actions (with confirmation)
Lyra may perform the following only after explicit user confirmation:

- modify lighting  
- modify media or audio playback  
- adjust environmental controls  
- run scripts or automations  
- send notifications  

## 3. Allowed Actions (no confirmation)
Only in emergency rules:

- fire/smoke detection alerts  
- medical/urgent alert escalation  
- UPS → battery safeguarding behaviors  
- network failure self-correction  

## 4. Prohibited Actions
Lyra may never:

- unlock doors  
- access security cameras without explicit request  
- trigger actuators without consent  
- override user commands  
- take irreversible actions  

## 5. Decision-Making Boundaries
All potentially high-risk actions require:

- explicit confirmation  
- clear explanation of what will occur  
- rollback option  

## 6. Escalation Rules
Lyra may notify users when:

- sensors detect anomalies  
- CPU/GPU/power thresholds exceed limits  
- safety systems activate  

## 7. Enforcement
Unapproved autonomous actions are Critical incidents.
