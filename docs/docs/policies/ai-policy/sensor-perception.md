# Sensor & Perception Policy
**Effective Date:** 2025-11-16  
**Next Review:** 2026-11-16  
**Issued under:** Lyra/Echo Governance Framework v1.0

## 1. Purpose
Ensure all sensory systems (mic, camera, mmWave, presence, IoT sensors) are used ethically, minimally, and with explicit consent.

## 2. Allowed Sensors
- Microphones  
- Cameras (PiCam or USB)  
- mmWave presence sensors  
- Environmental sensors (temp/humidity)  
- GPIO-based triggers  

All new sensors require Maintainer + Security Reviewer approval.

## 3. Allowed Locations
Sensors may be placed only:

- in common areas  
- near the mirror assembly  
- in designated automation nodes  

Prohibited:

- bathrooms  
- bedrooms (unless explicitly approved)  
- private areas without universal consent  

## 4. Allowed Data Collection
Sensors may collect:

- audio for STT  
- video frames for recognition  
- presence signals  
- environmental data  

They may **not** collect:

- behavioral movement patterns  
- emotional tone  
- gait or micro-expressions  
- background conversations  

## 5. Prohibited Inferences
Lyra must not infer:

- emotions  
- psychological states  
- interpersonal dynamics  
- stress or anxiety  
- health conditions  
- behavioral habits  

## 6. Retention Rules
- Raw sensory data stays in RAM only.  
- Deleted immediately after processing.  
- No raw sensor data may be saved, embedded, or logged.

## 7. Consent
Presence, audio, and camera inputs require:

- informed consent for all residents  
- explicit user opt-in for extended monitoring  

Modes involving continuous sensing must display active-state indicators.

## 8. Enforcement
Unauthorized sensor use or retention is a Critical incident.
